# Introduction

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is the programming of a computer to learn without explicit instructions on how to do so.

Tom Mitchell says that a computer program is said to learn from experience E with some respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E.

There are two types of learning: supervised and unsupervised.

## Supervised Learning

This is the most common type of machine learning.

A choice often has to be made as to whether a guess should be made in a linear fashion or with a quadratic function.
Quadratic functions include a second polynomial, so it is non-linear.

Supervised learning occurs when the "correct" answers are given and used to derive future values.

Regression problems are a certain sort where a continuous valued output has to be predicted.

Another sort of problem is a classification problem.
For these, there is a discrete valued output.

It is often beneficial to use more features in your determinations of classification.
Sometimes, an infinite number of attributes should be used.
Support vector machines allow for a computer to handle an infinite number of features.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning occurs when an initial dataset is given without any kind of inherent organization.
Basically, data points are given, but they do not come with any sort of classification.
An unsupervised learning algorithm will find structure in unstructured data.

Many problems are clustering problems, where you have to determine how many groups exist in a dataset.

Another type of problem in this realm is the non-clustering problem.
For instance, the scenario where a single scenario is recorded by two microphones allows for a partition to be made between different sounds in the scenario.
